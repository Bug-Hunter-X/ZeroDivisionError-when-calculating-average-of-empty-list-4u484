This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a ZeroDivisionError that occurs when attempting to compute the average of an empty list. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from directly dividing by the length of the list without checking for emptiness. The solution involves adding a check for an empty list and returning an appropriate value (0) in that case.
